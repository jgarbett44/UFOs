# UFO Sightings

## Overview

Starting with a JavaScript file that contains UFO sighting data, including location, shape, and date, we created an html page, using a table and filters to sort and visualize the data.

## Results

 - The HTML page is visually appealing, with a title, color image and article. https://github.com/jgarbett44/UFOs/blob/7fba7cb7a41fbf1e45ad4c0f2b36f743db517a35/Screenshots/UFO1.png

 - The unsorted data appears in a table when the page opens. https://github.com/jgarbett44/UFOs/blob/7fba7cb7a41fbf1e45ad4c0f2b36f743db517a35/Screenshots/UFO2.png

 - To the left of the table, we have five filters. https://github.com/jgarbett44/UFOs/blob/7fba7cb7a41fbf1e45ad4c0f2b36f743db517a35/Screenshots/UFO3.png

 - When one of the filters is changed, the page sifts through the data to return matches. Here, we entered the date, 1/10/2010. https://github.com/jgarbett44/UFOs/blob/7fba7cb7a41fbf1e45ad4c0f2b36f743db517a35/Screenshots/UFO4.png

## Summary

The data is limited. It only includes sightings in the US and Canada, and it only covers only a couple of weeks in January 2010. As a result, the webpage cannot show long-term trends.

For further development, we should update the filters so that they are not case-sensitive. Currently, it's necessary to search with lower-case letters only. Also, we should add a map to visualize locations.
